Both the baby and the mongoose grew. In five or six
months the mongoose had grown to its full size — a lovely
animal with two shining black eyes and a bushy tail. The
farmer’s son was still a baby in the cradle, sleeping and
crying alternately.
One day, the farmer’s wife wanted to go to the market. She
fed the baby and rocked him to sleep in his little
cradle. Picking up the basket, she said to her husband, “I’m
off to the bazar. The baby is sleeping. Keep an eye on him.
Frankly, I don’t like to leave the child alone with the mongoose.”
“You needn’t be afraid,” said the farmer. “The mongoose
is a friendly animal. It’s as sweet as our baby and they are
the best of friends, you know.”
The wife went away, and the farmer, having nothing to
do in the house, decided to go out and take a look at his
fields not far away. He ran into some friends on the way
back and didn’t return for quite some time.
